# Rose's Flower Shop


## What the project does and its value to users:

The project is intended to allow customers of Rose's Flower Shop to reserve arrangements of flowers that they want for events. This allows the workers at Rose's Flower Shop to see if the flowers are in season, when they can be ordered and when the package can be finished for the customer. 

The value it provides for the customer is it allows them to choose from packages easily and be contacted by the shop to finalise collection. The project also allows the customer to find the shop on a map or contact the shop by phone or email. 

## User Stories

"Initial testing of the website revealed a very well-built, easy-to-use website. I found the UI intuitive and easy to navigate, and the prices aren't so bad either! The pages are nicely laid out, the colour scheme is great and the design is really clean. 10/10." - Jordan 

"I found the website easy to use and navigate, even without my glasses as the text and icons were very clear! I often get a bit lost looking for shops I've never been toom, I would definitely use the map if I were out on the highstreet looking for the store" - Hilary

"As someone that loves to shop online but hates being overwhelmed by lists, prices and descriptions I really appreciate the simple design of the website. A lot of the time I just want to make a quick decision and leave the site, Rose's flower shop allows me to do that without too much visual noise" - Joe
