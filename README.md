# Rose's Flower Shop


## What the project does and its value to users:

The project is intended to allow customers of Rose's Flower Shop to reserve arrangements of flowers that they want for events. This allows the workers at Rose's Flower Shop to see if the flowers are in season, when they can be ordered and when the package can be finished for the customer. 

The value it provides for the customer is it allows them to choose from packages easily and be contacted by the shop to finalise collection. The project also allows the customer to find the shop on a map or contact the shop by phone or email.
