# Design 

## Colour Scheme 

![colour-palete](/docs/colour-palete.png)

I have used the colours shown in the colour palette here as I think they have a nice fresh energy to them and in a sense represent springtime, which is obviously when most flowers come into bloom. 

## Typography

The font "Merriweather" is used on the index page for the company history paragraph. It is a sans-serif font.
The font "Playfair Display" is used throughout the site for the prices and also the company logo. It is a sans-serif font. 

## Imagery

I will use images of different kinds of flower arrangements across the site to show the variety of packages that are available to customers.

## Wireframes

The site was designed on Balsamiq with desktop and mobile in mind and was later optimized to fit tablets also. Here are the original wireframes:

* [Wedding Packages Page](/docs/wedding-page-wireframe.png)
* [Birthday Packages Page](/docs/birthday-page-wireframe.png)

# Features

## General Features

The website is comprised of a home page, 2 pages of flower arrangements for different occasions, and a contact page. 

On these pages the features are: 
- a navigation bar
- social media links that are accessible by clicking the relevant icons 
- a form that allows the user to choose a package with a radio button
- a map to find the store in person/ to collect the reserved package 

## **The home page**

The home page for Rose's Flower shop on the desktop shows a slide show of the shop's best work, on mobile, it has one still image of a flower arrangement. Underneath the picture/slideshow, it has a paragraph on the company's history since it was established.

## **Birthdays Page**

The Birthdays page allows users to browse a selection (3) of flower arrangements and select one to reserve with a form. 

## **Weddings Page**

The Weddigss page allows users to browse a selection (6) of flower arrangements and select one to reserve with a form. 

## **Contact**

The contact page shows a map of the shop and also has a telephone number and email address for the customer. 

# Accessibility

I have been mindful whilst coding to ensure the website is accessible. This has been achieved by:
- Using semantic HTML
- Using sans-serif fonts for the site (These are easy-to-read fonts for people with dyslexia and learning difficulties)
- Adding alt text to images for users that are using a screen reader

## Solved Bugs

Navbar kept aligning left next to the logo. Fixed by adding the "justify-content-end" attribute to the navbar.

Navbar was not optimised on mobile or tablet. Fixed by targeting the navbar toggler and changing the width in chrome developer tools, then applying the rule to CSS.  

The Navbar position was moving down on tablets (devices over 509px). Fixed by adding a media query for screens with a minimum width of 509px. 

Slideshow syntax error, removed "-web kit-" prefix from animation and keyframes CSS.

## Deployment bugs

- File pathing had to be changed from gitpods file pathing to fit githubs. (fixed by adding Milestone-Project/ before file paths)
- When submitting form the page formdump.codeinstitute.net does not open, my mentor says this must be  an issue with Code Institutes servers.

## Version Control: 
Git & GitHub
